I mainly develop web applications in React, but also hybride mobile apps in React Native and Flutter. The 'VanheedePlus' app is one of the projects I co-created. I like speaking in front of an audience which is why I give presentations at meetups and schools. My current work involves micro frontend architecture, design systems & component libraries. I use Storybook to visualise and document the component libraries.",
